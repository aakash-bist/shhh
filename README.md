## 🚀 Getting Started

### Current Implementation (localStorage)

The app is **fully functional right now** using localStorage for message storage. No external setup required!

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd bhadas
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the app**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Start messaging!** 
   - Type your message and click "Publish Anonymously"
   - Messages are stored locally in your browser
   - Use the debug panel (🔧 button) to manage localStorage

### Future Firebase Integration

When you're ready to deploy with Firebase:

1. **Firebase Setup**
   - Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Enable Firestore Database
   - Get your Firebase config (Project Settings > General > Your apps)

2. **Configure Firebase**
   - Update `src/firebase.js` with your Firebase config
   - Replace localStorage calls in `src/hooks/useMessages.js` with Firebase functions
   - Set up Firestore security rules (see below)

3. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   firebase deploy
   ```

## 🔒 Firebase Security Rules (Future)

Set these Firestore security rules when you integrate Firebase:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /messages/{messageId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.resource.data.text is string 
                   && request.resource.data.text.size() <= 280
                   && request.resource.data.timestamp is timestamp;
      allow update, delete: if false;
    }
  }
}
```
